EAST OF EDEisr


‘John Steinbeck’s novel follows the pattern of The .
Pastures of Heaven but is on the scale of The Grapes of
Vratli. It is indeed longer; but it is also finer. We are
lack in the Salinas Valley, with its exuberance of '
latural beauty and wild Life which he knows so well,
nd with its rich varieties of human kind; but not-far •
iway is Salinas town with its stores, saloons, and ,
vhorehouses; and further back again are King Town,
vVatsonville, State politics, universities, and the First'
vVorld War. It is the story of families rooted in the
soil but torn apart by differences of birth and taste, by
primitive love and hate, and by civilized desires fol^.
more wealth than can be made by farming and better'
education than can be got at the local school. The ‘
Hamiltons and the Trasks recur in all four parts of
the epic. Samuel Hamilton, the patriarchal Irishman;
with his wife Liza standTor the power of good at the
back of things . , .


‘ Man alone has the choice of good and evil. And
this is illustrated in the characters of Adam Trask’s
sons, Caleb and Aron, who are really Cain and Abel.
For their mother is a moral monster, cruel and mali- ■
cious . . . and Caleb has to struggle against that ele-
ment of her in his make-up . . .
